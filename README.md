# Semantic-Parsing-using-Joshua
Using the open-source statistical machine translation decoder Joshua on semantic parsing for the FUNQL of Geoquery

Make use of the open-source statistical machine translation decoder Joshua on
sematic parsing for the FUNQL of Geoquery. It illustrates how mapping natural language to
formal language using Joshua.


The semantic parsing in this paper refers the task that mapping natural language to formal
language as Figure 1 shows.

What is the biggest city in Kansas ?    
answer(largest(city(loc_2(stateid('kansas')))))   
Figure 1 : natural language and formal language in FUNQL    


FUNQL is a functional, variable-free query language for Geoquery domain (Kate et al., 2005).
Sematic parsing here is cast as a machine translation task which translates one natural language
to another natural language.
Hiero refers to Hierarchical phrase-based ( David Chiang.2007.), it is a SCFG with a single
nonterminal category, shows in Figure 2.


[X] ||| Arkansas ||| 'arkansas' ||| 0 0 1 0.01832 0 0 ||| 0-0   
[X] ||| How big is [X,1] ? ||| size( stateid( [X,1] ||| 0.68535 7.21837 1 0.01832 0 0.33647 ||| 0-1   
1-0 2-1 4-1

A translation is correct if we can get the same answer from the GEOQUERY database as the
reference query.
Here in the evaluation module in WASP, it uses a Prolog development system SICStus to retrieve
the answer from GEOQUERY database.
