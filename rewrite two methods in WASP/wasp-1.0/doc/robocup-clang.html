		<h1>CLang: The RoboCup Coach Language</h1>
		
		<p>
			The RoboCup Coach Language (CLang) was developed to enable online coaches
			to change the behavior of simulated soccer players during games in the
			Simulated League.  Since a coach may work together with teams from
			different research groups, it is important for the coach language to
			have clear semantics that prevent misinterpretation from both the players
			and the coach.
		</p>

		<p>
			The CLang grammar that is used in our corpus is based on the one given in
			the following document (Section 7.7):
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Mao Chen, Klaus Dorer, Ehsan Foroughi, Fredrik Heintz, ZhanXiang Huang,
				Spiros Kapetanakis, Kostas Kostiadis, Johan Kummeneje, Jan Murray,
				Itsuki Noda, Oliver Obst, Pat Riley, Timo Steffens, Yi Wang and Xiang
				Yin.  <i>RoboCup Soccer Server Users Manual, for Soccer Server Version
				7.07 and later.</i>  February 11, 2003.
			</p>

		<p>
			CLang was not designed for use with an NL interface.  To make it easier
			to use, we have modified CLang, guided by the following principles:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				If a construct is too clumsy to describe using natural languages, then
				a more common specialization of the construct is introduced.  For
				example, <tt>(arc POINT 0 RADIUS 0 360)</tt> becomes <tt>(circle POINT
				RADIUS)</tt>.
			</li>
			<li>
				If there are simple concepts that can be easily described in natural
				languages, but are impossible to express in CLang, then new constructs
				that correspond to these concepts are introduced.  For example, 
				<tt>(left REGION)</tt> is a new construct that refers to the left half
				of <tt>REGION</tt> from our team's perspective.
			</li>
			<li>
				New constructs may be introduced by symmetry.  For example, the
				<tt>player</tt> predicate is introduced alongside
				<tt>player-except</tt> and <tt>player-range</tt>, so that players can
				be referenced in a unified manner.
			</li>
			<li>
				It must be easy to convert the new constructs back into CLang for use
				in the RoboCup Soccer Server.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			Here are the modifications that have been made:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				All references to players are made using the following constructs:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<tt>(player TEAM UNUM_SET)</tt> - the players in the team
						<tt>TEAM</tt> whose uniform number is in the set <tt>UNUM_SET</tt>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>(player-except TEAM UNUM_SET)</tt> - the players in the team
						<tt>TEAM</tt> whose uniform number is <b>not</b> in the set
						<tt>UNUM_SET</tt>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>(player-range TEAM UNUM<sub>1</sub> UNUM<sub>2</sub>)</tt> -
						the players in the team <tt>TEAM</tt> whose uniform number is
						between <tt>UNUM<sub>1</sub></tt> and <tt>UNUM<sub>2</sub></tt>
						(inclusive).
					</li>
				</ul>
				All constructs that contain references to individual players are made
				to accept <tt>player</tt>, <tt>player-except</tt> and
				<tt>player-range</tt> as arguments.  For example, <tt>(bowner our
				{6})</tt> becomes <tt>(bowner (player our {6}))</tt>.  <tt>(pass
				{2})</tt> becomes <tt>(pass (player our {2}))</tt>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<tt>(ppos TEAM UNUM_SET INT<sub>1</sub> INT<sub>2</sub> REGION)</tt>
				becomes:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<tt>(ppos-any (player TEAM UNUM_SET) REGION)</tt> if
						<tt>INT<sub>1</sub></tt> is 1 and <tt>INT<sub>2</sub></tt> is
						greater than or equal to the size of <tt>UNUM_SET</tt>.  (This
						corresponds to the <tt>ppos-all</tt> predicate that appeared in
						earlier versions of the CLang corpus.  <tt>ppos-any</tt> is a more
						appropriate name than <tt>ppos-all</tt>.)
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>(ppos-none TEAM REGION)</tt> if <tt>UNUM_SET</tt> is
						<tt>{0}</tt> and both <tt>INT<sub>1</sub></tt> and
						<tt>INT<sub>2</sub></tt> are zero.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<tt>(POINT<sub>1</sub> + ((pt ball) * POINT<sub>2</sub>))</tt> becomes
				<tt>(pt-with-ball-attraction POINT<sub>1</sub> POINT<sub>2</sub>)</tt>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<tt>(arc POINT 0 RADIUS ANGLE_BEGIN 360)</tt> becomes <tt>(circle POINT
				RADIUS)</tt>, regardless of the value of <tt>ANGLE_BEGIN</tt>.
			</li>
			<li>
				New constructs are introduced for the following pre-defined regions:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Rectangles:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<tt>(field)</tt> - the entire field.
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(half TEAM)</tt> - the <tt>TEAM</tt>'s half of the field.
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(penalty-area TEAM)</tt> - the <tt>TEAM</tt>'s penalty
								area.
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(goal-area TEAM)</tt> - the <tt>TEAM</tt>'s goal area.
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(midfield)</tt> - the entire midfield.
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(midfield TEAM)</tt> - the <tt>TEAM</tt>'s half of the
								midfield.
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(near-goal-line TEAM)</tt> - the area near the
								<tt>TEAM</tt>'s goal line.  (The <tt>very-near-goal-line</tt>
								predicate, which appeared in previous versions of the CLang
								corpus, becomes <tt>near-goal-line</tt>.  There was previously
								only one instance of <tt>very-near-goal-line</tt> in the
								corpus, and the two predicates are semantically very similar.)
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(from-goal-line TEAM X<sub>1</sub> X<sub>2</sub>)</tt> -
								<tt>X<sub>1</sub></tt> to <tt>X<sub>2</sub></tt> meters from
								the <tt>TEAM</tt>'s goal line.
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(left REGION)</tt> - the left half of <tt>REGION</tt> from
								our team's perspective.
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(right REGION)</tt> - the right half of <tt>REGION</tt>
								from our team's perspective.
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(left-quarter REGION)</tt> - the left quarter of
								<tt>REGION</tt> from our team's perspective.
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(right-quarter REGION)</tt> - the right quarter of
								<tt>REGION</tt> from our team's perspective.
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(reg-exclude REGION<sub>1</sub> REGION<sub>2</sub>)</tt> -
								the region <tt>REGION<sub>1</sub></tt> <b>minus</b> 
								<tt>REGION<sub>2</sub></tt>.  (This construct is used only when
								it results in a rectangular region.)
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Points:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<tt>(front-of-goal TEAM)</tt> - the point directly in front of
								the <tt>TEAM</tt>'s goal.
							</li>
							<li>
								<tt>(from-goal TEAM X)</tt> - the point <tt>X</tt> meters in
								front of the <tt>TEAM</tt>'s goal.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>

			Code that translates the new CLang constructs into the original CLang
			(and the pre-defined regions into exact <i>xy</i>-coordinates) is
			available upon request.
